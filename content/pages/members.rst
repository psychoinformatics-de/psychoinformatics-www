        <p>The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the
        animals is case they ever got off the island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene
        that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals
        can't manufacture the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually
        supplied with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.</p>

        <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has
        a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for
        murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I
        don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven
        of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
        oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that
        killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't
        hold a candle to man.</p>

        <p>You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time travel. And when
        we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How it's possible, how it's done,
        what the dangers are. But then why fifty years in the future when the
        spacecraft encounters a black hole does the computer call it an 'unknown
        entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't know, that means we
        never told anyone. And if we never told anyone it means we never made it
        back. Hence we die down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.</p>

        <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to

        That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same
        way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our
        lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and
        I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I like animals better than people sometimes... Especially dogs.
        Dogs are the best. Every time you come home, they act like they haven't
        seen you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is they got
        different dogs for different people. Like pit bulls. The dog of dogs.
        Pit bull can be the right man's best friend... or the wrong man's worst
        enemy. You going to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
        me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.</p>
