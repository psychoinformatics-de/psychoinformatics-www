Our research covers a broad range from advancing research methodology, to the
actual engineering of readily usable tools, to the application of such
developments to concrete research questions in medicine, psychology, or
cognitive neuroscience — because there is nothing worse than a solution without
a problem.

  <h2>Ongoing Projects</h2>

Most recently, our main research focus lies on studying the representation of
information about, and for interacting with, the environment. We believe that
ecologically valid conclusions about these representations can only be drawn
when they are also studied under conditions of real-life complexity. Hence our
aim is to combine controlled experiments with complex natural stimulation in
order to validate our findings.

This is a long-running project that aims to built a unique resource for
studying the brain's natural behavior. It combines brain imaging with other
data acquisition techniques to capture a versatile recording of the human
response to a prolonged complex natural stimulus, the motion picture "Forrest
Gump".

This project is an open invitation to anyone and everyone to participate in a
decentralized effort to explore the opportunities of open science in
neuroimaging. We aim to document how much (scientific) value can be generated
from the data releases — from the publication of scientific findings derived
from this dataset, algorithms and methods evaluated on this dataset, and/or
extensions of this dataset by the acquisition and incorporation of new data.

   Overview of functional (top), and structural (middle) brain
   imaging data, as well as annotations of the complex real-life stimulus
   (bottom) that are available through the studyforrest.org project.

Since 2014, a number of datasets have been publicly released for unrestricted
use, covering functional and structural brain imaging, eye tracking,
physiological recordings, and numerous annotations of the structure of the
movie stimulus. For up-to-date information on available data, funding, and our
many collaborators, please see the project homepage.

Data are key ingredients of science, but interesting data are often scattered
across many different locations, with heterogenous access methods, and are
packaged in a multitude of structures and formats. This makes it hard to
discover, obtain, and re-use existing data.

Datalad is a software engineering project that aims to deliver a data
management tool that aids data discovery, to simplify and homogenize access to
data across many providers, and to re-share data with a community. One could
think of Datalad as "Git for collections of datasets".

A such, this software is ideally suited for projects like our *studyforrest*
effort. It applies the successful model of collaborative, decentralized open
source software development to the domain of managing and sharing (scientific)
data.  Please see the `software page </software.html>`_ for more information.

   Datalad facilitates and homogenizes data exchange between peers, and
   tracking of resources from data portals. It is data format agnostic and
   exposes meta data to ease data discovery. Access to sensitive data is
   supported via configurable authentication schemes.

This project is executed in collaboration with `Yaroslav Halchenko (Dartmouth
College) <http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/ppl/yarik.html>`_, and is co-funded
by the US National Science Foundation (NSF; 1429999) and the German Federal
Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF; 01GQ1411) as part of a US-German
collaboration in computational neuroscience (CRCNS).

    <h3>Anticipation, Processing, and Control of Primary Rewards</h3>

.. image:: {filename}/img/logo/dfg.png
   :alt: DFG Logo
   :class: projectsponsorlogo

An investigation into the perception and neural representation of primary
rewards (i.e. tastes) of their visual correspondences (secondary rewards) and of
their (mis)matched combination in the human brain. The aims of this project are:
1) to identify the motivational, hedonic, and category-specific representations
(sweet, sour etc.) of primary rewards; 2) to identify the influence of secondary
reinforcers on these representations; and 3) identify the effects of
over-learned and novel visuo-gustatory correspondences on these and their
functional interplay by means of univariate fMRI-approaches (plus functional
connectivity), classification analysis, and functional hyperalignment.

This project is a collaboration with `Toemme Noesselt (Magdeburg University)
<http://www.ipsy.ovgu.de/Abteilungen/Biologische+Psychologie.html>`_, and is
funded by the German Research Council (DFG) as a part of the Collaborative
Research Center `SFB 779 <http://www.sfb779.de/en/>`_ in Magdeburg.

    <h3>Tracing the Template: Investigating the Representation of Perceptual Relevance</h3>

.. image:: {filename}/img/logo/dfg.png
   :alt: DFG Logo
   :class: projectsponsorlogo

This project seeks to identify the nature of attentional preferences of
cognitive behavior, in terms of function (how it affects our behavior),
physiology (how it is implemented in the brain), and time (how it is affected
by learning/selection history). Specifically, what preferences can it hold, how
do these change as a function of experience, and what are the neural codes
underlying these representations?

This project is a collaboration with `S. Pollmann (Magdeburg University)
<http://www.ipsy.ovgu.de/allgpsych.html>`_, M. Eimer (Birkbeck College,
University of London), and C.N.L. Olivers (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam). It is
co-funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG; PO 548/16-1).

    <h3>Building Common High-dimensional Models of Neural Representational Spaces</h3>

.. image:: {filename}/img/logo/bmbf.png
   :alt: BMBF Logo
   :class: projectsponsorlogo

It is possible to decode information from brain activation patterns with
multivariate analysis procedures. Despite this fact, little is known how neural
codes vary across individuals. The main disadvantage of current decoding
approaches is that they have to be built for each brain individually, because
it is difficult to bring two brains into alignment at a fine scale. This
project developed methods that allow for the detection and description of
common neural representations. Individual brain activity patterns are projected
into a common high-dimensional space, to build models of representational
spaces of cortical areas that are valid for a range of stimuli and across
individuals. This includes complex cortical networks that do not respond
consistently on direct stimulation (e.g. social cognition).

A collaboration with the groups of James V. Haxby (Dartmouth College, USA) and
Peter J. Ramadge (Princeton University, USA), this project was funded by the
German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (01GQ1112) as well as the US
National Science Foundation (1129764).

    <h3>Advanced fMRI-based Analysis of Human Sensory Cortex</h3>

.. image:: {filename}/img/logo/cbbs.png
   :alt: CBBS Logo
   :class: projectsponsorlogo

This project focused on the development and validation of new experimental and
neuro-computational approaches for the investigation of the neuronal processing
of sensory input to the human visual cortex. Novel approaches to decode
cortical processing with functional magnetic resonance tomography (fMRI) are
developed and applied to the analysis of the visual cortex. On the one hand
spatial high-resolution fMRI approaches are established, validated, and
optimized. On the other hand, multivariate data-analysis approaches are adapted,
optimized and applied to the analysis of fMRI data sets. These methodological
developments open up a wide range of applications, not only to deepen our
understanding of the healthy visual system, but also to investigate
pathophysiology and plasticity of the visual system for the optimization of
future therapeutic strategies.

A collaboration with Prof. Michael Hoffmann (Visual Processing Lab, Eye-Clinic,
Magdeburg), this project was funded by the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt as
part of the project "Center for Behavioral Brain Sciences".
