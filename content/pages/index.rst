  Psychologists live in an increasingly data-rich world, and our ability to make
  continued progress in understanding the mind and brain depends on finding new
  ways to organize and synthesize an ever-expanding body of knowledge.
  *— Yarkoni, Curr. Dir. Psych. SciIIence, 2012*

Research in this lab focuses on the interface of computer and information
sciences, neuroscience, and psychology. We develop tools and strategies to
employ inter-disciplinary expertise in psychological and neuroimaging research.
Our projects range from tailored solutions to specific problems (e.g. `PyMVPA
<http://www.pymvpa.org/>`_) to versatile research platforms (e.g.
`NeuroDebian <http://neuro.debian.net/>`_).

Our work in the press
=====================

We participated in the `Committee on Best Practice in Data Analysis and Sharing
(COBIDAS) <http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/cobidas>`_ that produced a
comprehesive report on how to conduct and report neuroimaging studies to aid
reproducibility in this area of research. This work has been featured in the
*New York Times* article "`Do You Believe in God, or Is That a Software Glitch?
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/opinion/sunday/do-you-believe-in-god-or-is-that-a-software-glitch.html>`_".

Our contributions to the Open Science movement have been highlighted in this
*Süddeutsche Zeitung* article: `Freie Daten für freie Forscher
<http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wissen/open-science-freie-daten-fuer-freie-forscher-1.2126615>`_.

The initial data release of our `studyforrest.org <http://studyforrest.org>`_
project has been reported on the German tech news site *heise.de*: `Open Science:
Forschungsdaten frei zugänglich. Magdeburger Hirnforscher veröffentlichen den
bislang umfangreichsten Rohdatensatz über die Verarbeitung von Sprache im
Gehirn <http://heise.de/-2210869>`_.
