Psychologists live in an increasingly data-rich world, and our ability to make
continued progress in understanding the mind and brain depends on finding new
ways to organize and synthesize an ever-expanding body of knowledge. (Yarkoni,
Curr. Dir. Psych. Science, 2012).

Research in this lab focuses on the interface of computer and information
sciences, neuroscience, and psychology. We develop tools and strategies to
employ inter-disciplinary expertise in psychological and neuroimaging research.
Our projects range from tailored solutions to specific problems (e.g. `PyMVPA
<http://www.pymvpa.org/>`_) all the way up to versatile research platforms (e.g.
`NeuroDebian <http://neuro.debian.net/>`_).
