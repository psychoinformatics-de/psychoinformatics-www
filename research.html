  <p>Our research covers a broad range from advancing research methodology, to
  the actual engineering of readily usable tools, to the application of such
  developments to concrete research questions in medicine, psychology, or
  cognitive neuroscience — because there is nothing worse than a solution
  without a problem.</p>

  <h2>Ongoing Projects</h2>

  <p>A main research focus lies on studying the representation of information
  about, and for interacting with, the environment. We believe that
  ecologically valid conclusions about these representations can only be drawn
  when they are also studied under conditions of real-life complexity.  Hence
  our aim is to combine controlled experiments with complex natural stimulation
  in order to validate our findings. The second major focus is the development
  of tools and workflow capable of managing and processing the large and
  versatile dataset that are required to pursue these research aims.</p>

    <h3>The studyforrest Project</h3>

    <p>This is a long-running project that aims to built a unique resource for
    studying the brain's natural behavior. It combines brain imaging with other
    data acquisition techniques to capture a versatile recording of the human
    response to a prolonged complex natural stimulus, the motion picture
    "Forrest Gump".</p>

    <p>We invite anyone and everyone to participate in this decentralized effort
    to explore the opportunities of open science in neuroimaging. One of our
    goals is to document how much (scientific) value can be generated — from the
    publication of scientific findings derived from this dataset, algorithms and
    methods evaluated on this dataset, and/or extensions of this dataset by the
    acquisition and incorporation of new data.</p>

      project.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Since 2014, a number of datasets have been publicly released for
    unrestricted use, covering functional and structural brain imaging, eye
    tracking, physiological recordings, and numerous annotations of the
    structure of the movie stimulus. For up-to-date information on available
    data, funding, and our many collaborators, please see the project

    <h3>DataLad</h3>

    <p>Data are key ingredients of science, but interesting data are often
    scattered across many different locations, with heterogeneous access methods,
    and are packaged in a multitude of structures and formats. This makes it
    hard to discover, obtain, and re-use existing data.</p>

    <p>DataLad is a software engineering project that aims to deliver a data
    management tool that aids data discovery, to simplify and homogenize access
    to data across many providers, and to re-share data with a community. One
    could think of DataLad as "Git for collections of datasets".</p>

    <p>As such, this software is ideally suited for projects like our
    <em>studyforrest</em> effort. It applies the successful model of
    collaborative, decentralized open source software development to the
    domain of managing and sharing (scientific) data.</p>

    <div class="figure">
      <img alt="DataLad data flow overview" src="/img/datalad_figure.png" />
      <p>DataLad facilitates and homogenizes data exchange between peers, and
      tracking of resources from data portals. It is data format agnostic and
      exposes meta data to ease data discovery. Access to sensitive data is
      supported via configurable authentication schemes.</p>

    <p>This project is executed in collaboration with
    <a href="http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/ppl/yarik.html">Yaroslav Halchenko (Dartmouth College)</a>,
    and is co-funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF 1429999,

    <h3>Information management for research on key mechanism of motor control in health and disease (SFB1451)</h3>

    <p>In this project we provide expertise for access, description, and
    modeling of data collected in the individual projects of the collaborative
    research center, as well as the two core data acquisition projects.
    This includes assessing general workflows, resource
    requirements, and data analysis processes to capture between-project
    differences that may impact data comparability and re-usability across
    projects. We provide tools, services and training to help projects
    align their research output to facilitate data analysis for extracting
    common activity patterns and mechanisms underlying motor behaviours across
    species, and promote data-driven computational modeling.</p>

    <p>This project is performed in collaboration with
    <a href="https://zoologie.uni-koeln.de/arbeitsgruppen/ag-daun/inhalt/mitarbeiterinnen/prof-dr-silvia-daun">
    Sylvia Daun (FZJ/U Cologne)</a>, and

    <h3>Anticipation, Processing, and Control of Primary Rewards</h3>

    <p>An investigation into the perception and neural representation of primary
    rewards (i.e. tastes) of their visual correspondences (secondary rewards)
    and of their (mis)matched combination in the human brain. The aims of this
    project are: 1) to identify the motivational, hedonic, and category-specific
    representations (sweet, sour etc.) of primary rewards; 2) to identify the
    influence of secondary reinforcers on these representations; and 3) identify
    the effects of over-learned and novel visuo-gustatory correspondences on
    these and their functional interplay by means of univariate fMRI-approaches
    (plus functional connectivity), classification analysis, and functional
    hyperalignment.</p>

    <p>This project is a collaboration with
    <a href="http://www.ipsy.ovgu.de/Abteilungen/Biologische+Psychologie.html">Toemme Noesselt (Magdeburg University)</a>,
    and is funded by the German Research Council (DFG) as a part of the

    <h3>Tracing the Template: Investigating the Representation of Perceptual Relevance</h3>

    <p>In this effort we seek to identify the nature of attentional preferences
    of cognitive behavior, in terms of function (how it affects our behavior),
    physiology (how it is implemented in the brain), and time (how it is
    affected by learning/selection history). Specifically, what preferences can
    it hold, how do these change as a function of experience, and what are the
    neural codes underlying these representations?</p>

    <p>This project is a collaboration with
    <a href="http://www.ipsy.ovgu.de/allgpsych.html">S. Pollmann (Magdeburg University)</a>,
    M. Eimer (Birkbeck College, University of London), and C.N.L.  Olivers
    (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam). It is co-funded by the German Research
    Foundation (DFG; PO 548/16-1).</p>

    <h3>Building Common High-dimensional Models of Neural Representational Spaces</h3>

    <p>It is possible to decode information from brain activation patterns with
    multivariate analysis procedures. Despite this fact, little is known how
    neural codes vary across individuals. The main disadvantage of current
    decoding approaches is that they have to be built for each brain
    individually, because it is difficult to bring two brains into alignment at
    a fine scale. This project developed methods that allow for the detection
    and description of common neural representations. Individual brain activity
    patterns are projected into a common high-dimensional space, to build models
    of representational spaces of cortical areas that are valid for a range of
    stimuli and across individuals. This includes complex cortical networks that
    do not respond consistently on direct stimulation (e.g. social
    cognition).</p>

    <p>A collaboration with the groups of James V. Haxby (Dartmouth College,
    USA) and Peter J. Ramadge (Princeton University, USA), this project was
    funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (01GQ1112)
    as well as the US National Science Foundation (1129764).</p>

    <h3>Advanced fMRI-based Analysis of Human Sensory Cortex</h3>

    <p>This project focused on the development and validation of new
    experimental and neuro-computational approaches for the investigation of the
    neuronal processing of sensory input to the human visual cortex. Novel
    approaches to decode cortical processing with functional magnetic resonance
    tomography (fMRI) are developed and applied to the analysis of the visual
    cortex. On the one hand spatial high-resolution fMRI approaches are
    established, validated, and optimized. On the other hand, multivariate
    data-analysis approaches are adapted, optimized and applied to the analysis
    of fMRI data sets. These methodological developments open up a wide range of
    applications, not only to deepen our understanding of the healthy visual
    system, but also to investigate pathophysiology and plasticity of the visual
    system for the optimization of future therapeutic strategies.</p>

    <p>A collaboration with Prof. Michael Hoffmann (Visual Processing Lab,
    Eye-Clinic, Magdeburg), this project was funded by the federal state of
    Saxony-Anhalt as part of the project "Center for Behavioral Brain
    Sciences".</p>
